# Hi there, I'm Sajjad Ayoubi ðŸ‘‹

Growing up, I always wanted to make new things. When I learned about Computer Science in my teens, I realized that I could make cool things with it. Since then, Artificial Intelligence became my tool for doing so. I've used Youtube's open courses as my university to learn Programming, English, Math, AI, and many other subjects. Every day, I strive to be better 1% at a time, and to be more productive. My interests include Neuroscience and Psychology, Personal Development, and Making Friends with Nice People.
